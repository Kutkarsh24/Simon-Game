# Simon-Game
This project is a Simon Game recreation, developed to practice the fundamental workings of JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS for structuring and styling. The game mimics the classic Simon memory game, challenging the player to repeat increasingly complex sequences of colors and sounds.
Features

•	Interactive gameplay with sounds and color sequences.
•	Dynamic difficulty: sequences grow longer with each correct answer.
•	Game logic implemented using pure JavaScript.
•	Visual and sound effects integrated with the game’s behavior.

How to Play

1.	Press the start button to begin.
2.	Watch the sequence of lights.
3.	Repeat the sequence by clicking the corresponding buttons.
4.	The sequence lengthens after each successful attempt. Repeat the process as long as you can without making a mistake!

Project Details

•	Technology Stack: JavaScript (logic), HTML (structure), CSS (styling)
•	Purpose: This project was built to understand the core principles of JavaScript, including event handling, timers, and DOM manipulation.
