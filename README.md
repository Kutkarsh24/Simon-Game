# Simon-Game
This project is a Simon Game recreation, developed to practice the fundamental workings of JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS for structuring and styling. The game mimics the classic Simon memory game, challenging the player to repeat increasingly complex sequences of colors and sounds.
